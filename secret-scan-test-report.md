- ✅ **Unit Tests Passed:** 12/15 tests successful
- ❌ **Integration Tests Failed:** 3/15 tests failed
- ✅ **Entropy Tests:** All 5 tests passed
- ✅ **Context Tests:** All 7 tests passed

### Critical Test Failures Identified
```
FAILED TESTS:
1. test_end_to_end_secrets_detection - Expected 1 AWS key, found 0
2. test_nested_directory_scanning - Pattern name mismatch: "AWS Access Key ID" vs "AWS Access Key"  
3. test_performance_with_large_files - Same pattern name mismatch
```

### Cargo Tarpaulin Coverage Testing
- **Installation:** Successfully installed cargo-tarpaulin v0.32.8
- **Execution:** Attempted but timed out after 3 minutes
- **Status:** Coverage analysis incomplete due to timeout

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The codebase contains test failures indicating pattern matching inconsistencies and potential issues with secret detection logic.

## End-to-End Functionality Testing ✅

Despite test failures, all documented CLI features were successfully tested:

### 1. Basic Scanning ✅
```bash
$ secretscan .
Warning: Found 256 potential secrets in current directory
```

### 2. Directory Scanning ✅
```bash
$ secretscan mock-repo  
Warning: Found 73 potential secrets:
- AWS Access Key ID: 5 detections
- Generic Secret: 18 detections
- Google API Key: 3 detections
- GitHub Token: 1 detection
- Stripe API Key: 5 detections
- SendGrid API Key: 3 detections
- And 28 other pattern types
```

### 3. JSON Output Format ✅
```bash
$ secretscan --format json mock-repo
```
**Result:** Successfully generated valid JSON with structured output including file paths, line numbers, pattern names, matched text, and entropy scores.

### 4. File Output ✅
```bash
$ secretscan --output results.txt mock-repo
✓ Results written to results.txt
```
**Result:** Successfully saved scan results to file with proper formatting.

### 5. Quiet Mode ✅
```bash
$ secretscan --quiet mock-repo
```
**Result:** Progress bar suppressed while maintaining full output.

### 6. Test Filtering ✅
```bash
$ secretscan --skip-tests mock-repo
```
**Result:** Reduced findings from 73 to 61 secrets, demonstrating effective test file filtering.

### 7. GitIgnore Support ✅
**Verification:** Created .gitignore file with exclusion patterns - scanner properly respects gitignore rules.

### 8. Custom Patterns Support ✅
**Created custom_patterns.json:**
```json
[
  {"name": "CustomKey", "regex": "CUSTOM_[A-Z0-9]{16}"},
  {"name": "InternalToken", "regex": "INT_[a-f0-9]{32}"},
  {"name": "LegacySecret", "regex": "LEGACY_[A-Za-z0-9+/]{24}"}
]
```
**Result:** Scanner automatically detected and used custom patterns.
